        Various lists of world wonders have existed throughout history – some of the oldest lists are over 2,000 years
        old! These lists showcase some of the world’s most spectacular human-built structures. In this list, we’ve based
        our selection on the New Seven Wonders of the World that was announced in 2007.

        <li><u>Great Wall of China </u></li>
        <details><ul>
            <li> The Great Wall of China was built during the Qin dynasty to protect the borders of the ancient Chinese
                states in imperial China against invasion by foreigners. It also had an economic benefit, as it provided
                border controls and allowed the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road.

                This longest wall in the world is a collection of several walls built during the 7th century BC which
                were later joined together. The most famous among these walls is the one built by Qin Shi Huang during
                220–206 BC. The fortifications are made up of stone, brick, wood, and many other materials.</li>

        <li><u>Petra</u></li>
       <details>
        <ul>
            <li> The city of Petra is an archaeological site in Jordan that lies on the slope of Mount Jebel al-Madhbah.
                In 1984, UNESCO described it as “half built and half carved into the rock at the interior of a circle of
                mountains…is obviously one of the most precious cultural properties [of] man’s cultural heritage”.

                Petra, also known as the “Rose City”, was built by the Nabataeans who inhabited in the city for more
                than a thousand years. They used the city’s location to lay the foundation of a trading hub. The place
                is not only famous for its rock architecture of vibrant vermilion, moon white and pink colors, but also
                for its innovative water conduit system.

                Fun fact – Petra was used as the setting where Indiana Jones finds the Holy Grail in the 1989
                blockbuster Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.</li>

       <li><u>Colosseum</u></li>
<details>
    <ul>
        <li>This partially ruined amphitheater in Rome,  the Colosseum, is the largest amphitheatre ever built. Its
            original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium.

            In AD 72, the Roman emperor Vespasian laid the foundation of this monument. This structure had the
            capacity to hold approximately 50,000–80,000 spectators. The place was mostly used for gladiator
            contests, executions, animal hunts and re-enactments of famous battles and dramas. Despite being ruined
            by natural and man-made catastrophes, it still pulls a large number of tourists.

<li><u>Chichen Itza</u> </li>
        <details>
            <ul>
                <li>The Chichen Itza is the most visited heritage site in Mexico. It was once a large pre-Columbian city
                    made by the Mayan people. This site reveals the mixture of the architectural styles of Mexico, Puuc and
                    Chenes.
    
                    This pyramid, also known as the Temple of the Warriors, structure comprises of a number of square
                    terraces and staircases on each of the four sides of the temple. It is a fine sight during the spring
                    and autumn equinoxes. The sun creates a series of triangular shadows, creating an illusion of a serpent
                    crawling down the stairs.

        <li><u>Taj Mahal</u> </li>
       <details>
        <ul>
            <li>The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan constructed this jewel of Muslim art to accommodate the tomb of Mumtaz
                Mahal, his dearest wife. Ustad Isa, the master architect of this heritage site had efficiently captured
                the varied moods of Mumtaz in this ivory-white marble mausoleum.

                The Taj Mahal reveals varied shades of color throughout the day, including a soft golden color in the
                morning and during sunset. It took approximately 20 years and 20,000 labourers and artists to create
                this renowned beauty.

        <li><u>Machu Picchu</u> </li>
        <details>
            <ul>
                <li>Located in the Cusco Region, Machupicchu district in Peru, these ancient Incan ruins have been a
                    favorite destination among tourists.
    
                    These ruins include palaces, temples and homes which may have been constructed for a ceremonial or
                    military purpose, or as a retreat for the royals. They are surrounded by the stormy and chaotic Urubamba
                    River flowing in the Sacred Valley.
    
                    Due to the lack of records of written language, we don’t have any information about why the Incas built
                    this heritage site or abandoned it. In 1911, American historian Hiram Bingham introduced this isolated
                    place and brought it to international attention. Presently, most of the buildings in Machu Picchu have
                    been reconstructed.

        <li><u>Christ the Redeemer</u> </li>
<details>
    <ul>
        <li> Christ the Redeemer is an art deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

            This structure was created by the combined efforts of French sculptor Paul Landowski, Brazilian engineer
            Heitor da Silva Costa, Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida and French engineer Albert Caquot. Situated at
            the apex of Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, this awe-inspiring statue weighs 635 metric tons and is
            30-meter tall. It’s made of concrete and a mosaic of many triangular soapstones.</li>
